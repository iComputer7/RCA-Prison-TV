# SAFETY WARNING!!!!

CRTs operate on tens of thousands of volts, which ***will severely injure or kill you if proper precautions are not taken!!*** ***Always use the proper tools and safety equipment!***

*You* assume your own risk by choosing to disassemble *your* things. I am not responsible for your actions and as such, I am not responsible for destruction of property, personal injury, or personal death.

## RCA-Prison-TV

My documentation of the RCA J13804/J13805 CRT television, plus some modifications to make it more usable.

## Mods

Since this TV is just a stripped down version of other RCA consumer TVs, we can add back functionality to it by adding components and flipping some bits in the EEPROM.
